## 🧠 About

This repository is dedicated to exploring the power of GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) and understanding how motion enhances user experience on the web.

Rather than static interfaces, the goal here is to build dynamic, engaging, and visually expressive interactions using modern animation techniques.

This is an evolving repository and will continuously grow as I experiment with new animation concepts.
